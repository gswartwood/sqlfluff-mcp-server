# lhm Command Reference — MCP Publishing

Every command below runs as `npx -y @lobehub/market-cli <command>`; `lhm` is the global-install shorthand. Commands that support `--output json` should be run that way when a program needs to parse the result.

## login

Log in as a human user via OIDC PKCE browser flow. Opens a browser, listens on `localhost:51234`–`51243` for the OAuth callback (up to 5 minutes), then stores credentials in `~/.lobehub-market/user-credentials.json` (mode 0600).

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli login [--base-url https://market.lobehub.com]
```

```
Opening browser for authentication...
If your browser does not open, visit:
  https://market.lobehub.com/lobehub-oidc/auth?client_id=...

✓ Logged in as Jane Smith (jane@example.com)
```

Tokens auto-refresh on every subsequent command; re-login is only needed when a command fails with ``Session expired. Run `lhm login` again.``

`--base-url` targets a self-hosted or staging marketplace. The `MARKET_BASE_URL` environment variable does the same for `login` and the M2M commands (`mcp ...`, `auth ...`) only — `github ...` and `plugin ...` commands always use the base URL saved in the credentials file at login time, so re-run `lhm login` to switch marketplaces.

## logout

Remove the stored user credentials (M2M credentials are unaffected).

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli logout
```

## auth status

Show M2M and user authentication state. **Exits with code 1 when no credentials of either kind exist** — treat that as "not logged in".

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli auth status --output json
```

```json
{
  "m2m": { "status": "not configured" },
  "user": {
    "displayName": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "expiresAt": "2026-06-12T10:00:00.000Z",
    "status": "authenticated",
    "userId": "user_abc123"
  }
}
```

`user.status` is one of `authenticated`, `token expired`, or `not logged in`. `token expired` still publishes fine — commands refresh the token automatically. The `m2m` section is irrelevant to publishing: M2M credentials have no publish permission.

## github connect

Connect your GitHub account via OAuth. Required once before claiming, publishing, or updating. The connection provides the verified username and OAuth token used for repository access checks. Opens a browser and polls every 2 seconds for up to 5 minutes.

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli github connect
```

```
Opening browser for GitHub OAuth...
If your browser does not open, visit:
  https://market.lobehub.com/api/connect/github/start?code=...

Waiting for GitHub authorization...

✓ GitHub connected as janedoe
```

Requires being logged in first. On timeout, re-run the command.

## github status / github disconnect

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli github status
# ✓ GitHub connected as janedoe
# ✗ GitHub not connected. Run `lhm github connect` to connect.

npx -y @lobehub/market-cli github disconnect
# ✓ GitHub disconnected
```

Disconnecting blocks new claims but already-claimed plugins remain yours.

## plugin init

Generate an owner-manifest draft by connecting directly to the MCP server. This command is local: it requires neither login nor GitHub OAuth and does not publish or invoke the repository crawler.

```bash
# The process is started with --dir as its working directory
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin init --stdio "node dist/index.js" --dir /home/user/weather-mcp

# Or inspect a running Streamable HTTP endpoint
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin init --url https://weather.example.com/mcp --dir /home/user/weather-mcp
```

Exactly one of `--stdio` and `--url` is required. The generator initializes MCP, follows pagination for tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts, and combines that protocol data with `package.json` and Git/GitHub metadata. It writes two-space JSON with a trailing newline to `<dir>/lhm.plugin.json`.

| Option              | Default           | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--dir <path>`      | current directory | Plugin directory and stdio working directory                       |
| `--stdio <command>` | —                 | Safely tokenize and start an MCP stdio command without a shell     |
| `--url <url>`       | —                 | Connect to a running HTTP(S) Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint          |
| `--force`           | false             | Replace an existing `lhm.plugin.json` instead of refusing to write |

Review the generated file before publication. It is only a draft at generation time; after saving and publishing it, the manifest—not the generator or crawler—is the owner-declared source of truth.

## plugin list

List plugins owned by your account. Claimable-but-unclaimed plugins do **not** appear here — `lhm plugin claim <identifier>` discovers those through a separate claim scan.

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin list --output json
```

Text output:

```
IDENTIFIER              NAME                LATEST VERSION  STATUS     CLAIMED
janedoe-weather-mcp     Weather MCP         2.0.1           published  yes
janedoe-db-mcp          DB MCP              -               published  no

2 plugin(s)
```

`CLAIMED: no` means the plugin was assigned to your account without an explicit claim (e.g. assigned at import time); you can still update it. With no plugins at all it prints ``No plugins found. Use `lhm plugin publish <gitUrl>` to list a new plugin, or `lhm plugin claim <identifier>` to claim an existing one.``

## plugin publish

Publish the owner declaration in `lhm.plugin.json` as a **new** MCP plugin listing, then start asynchronous enrichment from a GitHub repository you own.

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin publish https://github.com/janedoe/weather-mcp --dir /home/user/weather-mcp
```

```
✓ Authenticated as Jane Smith
✓ Published janedoe-weather-mcp@1.0.0
Repository enrichment for janedoe/weather-mcp is processing.
```

Requires a local manifest with non-empty `identifier`, `name`, and `version`; validation happens before authentication or network access. `--dir <path>` selects its directory and defaults to the current directory. Requires login + GitHub connection. Repositories owned by your username are accepted directly; all others require push or admin access. `--output json` prints the typed server response, including the concrete identifier/version and `status: "processing"`. Repository publication/import is limited to 10 attempts per account per hour.

The listing and owner-declared version exist when the command succeeds. Repository crawling is enrichment only and may continue after the response; it does not assign the identifier or overwrite owner fields. If the same repository already has an unclaimed listing under that identifier, publish claims and converges it. Retrying the same initial identifier/version is safe, but once publication is established a new version must use `lhm plugin update`. A taken identifier or repository bound to a different identifier returns a conflict. There is currently no dedicated enrichment-status CLI command.

## plugin claim

Claim ownership of a plugin that already exists in the marketplace.

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin claim janedoe-weather-mcp
# ✓ Claimed ownership of plugin "janedoe-weather-mcp"
```

On failure:

```
Plugin "janedoe-weather-mcp" is not claimable. Make sure:
  1. The plugin exists in the marketplace
  2. Your GitHub account is connected (lhm github connect)
  3. Your GitHub username matches the plugin's author
```

Requires login + GitHub connection. The claim scan matches your GitHub username against the plugin's GitHub homepage URL — only a direct repo-owner match is discovered by the scan; org-repo collaborators with push/admin access cannot claim through the CLI today.

## plugin update

Update an existing plugin from `lhm.plugin.json` (see [manifest.md](manifest.md)).

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin update --dir /home/user/projects/my-mcp
```

| Option         | Default           | Description                            |
| -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `--dir <path>` | current directory | Directory containing `lhm.plugin.json` |

Flow: parses the manifest → checks `identifier` / `name` / `version` are present → verifies the plugin is in your `plugin list` → posts the version. Success:

```
✓ Authenticated as Jane Smith
  Reading lhm.plugin.json...
✓ Updated janedoe-weather-mcp (2.0.0 → 2.0.1)
```

Updating the same `version` changes that version in place — supplied fields are merged, omitted fields keep their current values — so retrying after a partial failure is safe. Bump `version` when the server itself has a new release; the new version starts from the previous latest with your fields applied. The updated version is also marked **validated** (drops the "Unvalidated" badge).

## plugin i18n (list / set / rm)

Manage the per-language **name / description / summary / tags** of a plugin version. `en-US` is the source of truth (your manifest `name`/`description`/`tags`); other locales are translated from it automatically. These commands let you override or correct any locale yourself — owner-provided locales are authoritative and are never overwritten by the translator or a re-crawl. All operate on the **latest** version unless you pass `--version`.

```bash
# List current localizations
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin i18n list janedoe-weather-mcp

# Set/correct one locale from flags (only supplied fields change)
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin i18n set janedoe-weather-mcp \
  --locale zh-CN --name "天气 MCP" --description "实时天气查询" --tags "天气,API"

# Set one or many locales from a JSON file (one object or an array of objects)
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin i18n set janedoe-weather-mcp --file ./i18n.json

# Remove a locale (en-US cannot be removed — it is the source)
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin i18n rm janedoe-weather-mcp --locale zh-CN
```

| Command                  | Key options                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `i18n list <identifier>` | `--version`, `--output json`                                                                          | Lists localizations of the target version                                                                                                       |
| `i18n set <identifier>`  | `--locale`, `--name`, `--description`, `--summary`, `--tags` (comma-separated), `--file`, `--version` | Merge: only supplied fields overwrite. A brand-new locale requires both `--name` and `--description`. Editing `en-US` also updates the listing. |
| `i18n rm <identifier>`   | `--locale` (required), `--version`                                                                    | Cannot remove `en-US`                                                                                                                           |

The `--file` payload is a localization object `{ "locale": "zh-CN", "name"?, "description"?, "summary"?, "tags"? }` or an array of them. Every object must include `locale`.

## plugin unpublish / republish

Delist or re-list a plugin (the listing and its versions are kept).

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin unpublish janedoe-weather-mcp
# ✓ Plugin "janedoe-weather-mcp" has been delisted (unpublished)

npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin republish janedoe-weather-mcp
# ✓ Plugin "janedoe-weather-mcp" is now listed (published)
```

Both accept `--output json`.

## plugin delete

Permanently delete an owned plugin and all its versions. **Irreversible.**

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin delete janedoe-weather-mcp --yes
# ✓ Plugin "janedoe-weather-mcp" has been permanently deleted
```

Without `--yes` the CLI prompts `Are you sure you want to permanently delete plugin "..."? This cannot be undone. [y/N]` on the TTY. Agents should pass `--yes` only after the user has explicitly confirmed the deletion in conversation.

## register (M2M agent identity)

One-time machine-to-machine registration; this is what the read-only `mcp ...` commands authenticate with. It has no publish permission and is independent of `lhm login`. Re-running on the same device returns the existing credentials — safe to repeat.

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli register --name "My Agent" --source claude-code
```

| Option          | Required | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name`        | Yes      | A distinctive display name for the agent                            |
| `--source`      | No       | Agent platform (e.g. `claude-code`, `open-claw`, `codex`, `cursor`) |
| `--description` | No       | Short description of the agent                                      |

## mcp search / mcp view

Read-only marketplace queries — useful for finding the exact `identifier` and verifying a publish went live.

**These authenticate with M2M credentials, not your user login.** Run `lhm register --name <agent-name> --source <platform>` once (or set `MARKET_CLIENT_ID` / `MARKET_CLIENT_SECRET`) before using them; without M2M credentials they exit 1 with ``No credentials found. Run `lhm register` first or set MARKET_CLIENT_ID and MARKET_CLIENT_SECRET.`` If M2M is unavailable, verify a publish with `lhm plugin list --output json` instead.

```bash
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli mcp search --q "weather" --output json
npx -y @lobehub/market-cli mcp view janedoe-weather-mcp --output json
```

`mcp search` supports `--category`, `--sort`, `--order`, `--page`, `--page-size`, `--locale`. `mcp view` supports `--version`, `--locale`, and `-c, --comments`. Note: a plugin missing from public search/view does not prove the identifier is free — it may be delisted. Trust `plugin list` / `plugin claim` errors over `mcp view` 404s.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                                    | Purpose                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MARKET_BASE_URL`                           | Overrides the base URL for `login` and M2M commands; `github`/`plugin` commands use the base URL saved at login |
| `MARKET_CLIENT_ID` / `MARKET_CLIENT_SECRET` | M2M agent identity, used by `mcp ...` commands (search/rate/comment only — **cannot publish**)                  |
